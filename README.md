**Fantasy Football Trade Analyzer Back-End**

My Fantasy Football Trade Analyzer is a full-stack application that utilizes a front-end built in React and a back-end built with Express, Node, and Mongoose. As a Software Engineer and an avid fantasy football fan, this was the perfect project to combine my two passions. The application uses an algorithm I developed that converts FantasyPros' Rest of Season rankings into a player rating fom 0.05 to 15, and uses those player ratings to evaluate a trade.

**Build Status**

I plan on maintaining this project throughout the Fantasy Football Season, and each season going forward. The front-end will see small tweaks to improve the look, but the majority of the maintenance work will be done on the back end. At a minimum you can expect to see weekly updates to this repo to update player rankings and ratings. I plan on updating these rankings at a minimum every Wednesday. 

Known bugs/Planned fixes

- There are no current bugs that I am aware of with my database. I am manually updating ratings and rankings each Wednesday, so please feel free to let me know of any misspellings, broken links to photos, or other issues that may arise. I plan on utilizing a web scraper at some point to help make keeping track of ratings easier, which will lead to more frequent updates.
